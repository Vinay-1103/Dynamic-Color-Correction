# Dynamic-Color-Correction

# 🎨 Dynamic Color Correction

A project that automatically adjusts image or video colors in real time based on lighting conditions or user preferences. Useful in image enhancement, low-light correction, and style matching.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Automatic brightness and contrast enhancement
- 🎯 Real-time dynamic color balancing
- 🖼️ Supports image and video files
- 🌗 Adaptive correction based on ambient light (if sensor/data available)
- 💻 Easy to integrate into existing pipelines

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Loads image or video input
2. Analyzes histogram or pixel distribution
3. Applies algorithms such as:
   - Histogram Equalization
   - CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
   - White Balance Correction
4. Outputs enhanced media with corrected colors

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- Python / OpenCV / NumPy
- (Optional) Real-time input with webcam
- (Optional) Tkinter / Streamlit UI for user interaction

## 🖥️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-color-correction.git
cd dynamic-color-correction
pip install -r requirements.txt
